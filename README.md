## Sitespeed.io Web Interface


This repo is carved out of https://github.com/blackmamba/sitespeediowebinterface and have been enhanced to a great extent to accomodate the needs of IT and Business users to run sitespeed.io on-demand.

With this revision and implementation you can now run sitespeed.io in PRODUCTION, staging, and other QA environments within your organization for the docker implementation. You can also, customize this to run for non-docker implementations - once you understand the PHP implementation.

## PRE-REQUISITE - Setting up Sitespeed.io Using DOCKER

You will need sitespeed.io installed on your local or QA or PROD environment to test this implementation. For now, let us install it on your local machine.

* Visit https://hub.docker.com/r/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/
* docker pull sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:6.4.1 (using the TAG)
* OR just docker pull sitespeedio/sitespeed.io (for latest version)

#### SAMPLE - Docker run for Sitespeed.io

* **docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io http://www.sitespeed.io/ -b chrome --speedIndex --video**

## INSTALL NGINX with PHP enabled

We will install Nginx on Mac, setup the sitespeed.io, and configure sitespeed.io.php to test this implementation.

$ **brew install nginx** (use homebrew to install nginx on Mac)

Following the brew install nginx -- you will notice below message indicating the location of the nginx docroot and the config files

==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/nginx-1.13.12.sierra.bottle
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring nginx-1.13.12.sierra.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats

**Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www**

The default port has been set in **/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf** to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  **brew services start nginx**
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  **nginx**
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.13.12: 23 files, 1.4MB

#### Modify Nginx conf to enable PHP (assuming you have PHP installed on your Mac)

* Uncomment below lines in the nginx.conf to enable PHP
* Also, I've created a folder under the docroot called "scripts" where I would place phpinfo.pho 
* phpinfo.php just has a basic PHP code to print PHP info page when called from browser

#### pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
  location ~ \.php$ {
  	root           html;
    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_index  index.php;
    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/local/var/www/scripts$fastcgi_script_name;
    include        fastcgi_params;
  }

#### Restart nginx to enable the changes

* $ **brew services restart nginx**
